Video Demonstration
For a visual walkthrough of this setup, please refer to the attached video demonstrating the entire process of setting up your scalable web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and using SQL Electron to view database details.

our  scalable web application is now set up on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with RDS, and we can use SQL Electron to access and manage your database.



This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a scalable web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with an RDS database and using SQL Electron to view database details.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. *AWS Elastic Beanstalk:* You should have an AWS account and be familiar with AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying your web application.

2. *SQL Electron:* Make sure you have SQL Electron installed on your local machine. SQL Electron is a tool that allows you to connect to databases and run SQL queries.

## Step 1: Creating an Elastic Beanstalk Environment

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
3. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment with the appropriate platform for your web application.
4. Upload your web application code.

## Step 2: Download WordPress Files Locally (PHP-Based)

1. Download the WordPress files to your local machine. You can obtain the latest version of WordPress from the official WordPress website (https://wordpress.org/download/).
   
   For example, you can use the following command to download WordPress via the terminal:

   bash
   wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
   

 Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file manually from the website and extract its contents to a directory on your local machine.

2. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

3. Inside the extracted folder, you'll find the core WordPress files and directories. These files will be used to configure and customize your web application.

4. Configure the necessary settings in your WordPress installation, such as the wp-config.php file, to connect to your RDS database. Make sure to update the database connection information with the RDS endpoint, username, password, and database name.

With the WordPress files downloaded and configured locally, you're ready to deploy and connect your PHP-based web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and the RDS database, as outlined in the subsequent steps.

## Step 3: Load Balancer, Auto Scaling, and RDS Configuration

As part of the Elastic Beanstalk environment setup, a Load Balancer and Auto Scaling are generated. Ensure that these configurations meet your traffic requirements.

1. Configure Auto Scaling rules as needed.
2. Set up an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance for your application's database. Note down the RDS endpoint and database credentials.
3. Note: Before connecting to SQL Electron with the RDS DNS endpoint address, make sure to allow all traffic in the RDS instance's security group to enable external connections.

## Step 4: Connect Your Web Application to RDS

1. In your local application files, edit the appropriate configuration files to update the database connection details with the RDS endpoint, username, password, and database name.

## Step 5: Install and Configure Login/Signup Plugin

1. From the web application admin dashboard, if applicable, go to the "Plugins" section.
2. Search for and install a login/signup plugin of your choice.
3. Activate the plugin.

## Step 6: Add Login Data

1. Configure the login/signup plugin with the necessary settings.
2. Create admin accounts and any other users as needed.

## Step 7: View Database Details Using SQL Electron

1. Ensure SQL Electron is installed on your local machine.
2. Launch SQL Electron and connect to your RDS database using the database credentials.
3. You can now view and manage your application's database using SQL queries and interact with your data as needed.

Your scalable web application is now set up on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with RDS, and you can use SQL Electron to access and manage your database.
